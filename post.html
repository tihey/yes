                    <p>His legendary status also comes from the fact that it was he who seemingly implanted the fear of horses to the Wargals. In the battle of Hackham Heath during Morgarath's rebellion, he led a large force of Araluen cavalry through a secret ford and ambushed Morgarath's army, relieving the beleaguered Araluen main force and routing Morgarath's army. The few surviving Wargals created a fear of horses among further generations. At this time a man called Daniel saved Halt from a guaranteed death when he was almost defeated by Wargals through sheer weight of numbers (Halt took a bad blow to his skull as it was). This man gave his life to spare Halt's and, with hid dying breath, begged Halt to protect his son, Will. He took him to Redmont, to live in the castle ward, until Will showed skills of a Ranger.</p>

<p>Halt's closest friend is Crowley, the Ranger Corps Commandment, and they both get along very well. Their friendship developed when they were young rangers, on the run from Morgarath, and they are known to have revitalized the Ranger Corps. Just after that period Halt and Crowley soon began to build on the legends of the Rangers by defeating an evil bandit. This is discussed in the short story The Hibernian, and the recent book The Tournament at Gorlan.</p>

<p>Halt is also one of King Duncan's most trusted advisors, and the King is saddened when he is left with no alternative but to banish Halt for a year in The Icebound Land. Halt publicly insults him so he can go after Will, who had been kidnapped by Skandians in the events of book two. Halt is grieved by this also though he tried not to let it show (as ever). Halt is also an enemy of Temujai as he "borrowed" a breed of their horses so that the Rangers have their horses today, and he also learned to make a recurve bow during his stay with them. Not much is known about the period he spent with the Temujai apart from that he fought alongside and also against them. His skills with his weapons are so legendary and skillful that even if he claims that he had missed his shot, everyone knows he had hit it. His longbow is larger than that of most Rangers', as in Halt's Peril, Will states his longbow is " One of the heaviest he'd seen, and even the strongest man, without proper technique could only bring it to half draw". He is likely the most skilled of all the Rangers. He is described as being slightly more accurate and a faster shooter than his former apprentice, Will, who is a better shot than Crowley and Gilan. However, Will is said to be nearly as skilled as his mentor, and may even surpass him with more training, which Halt himself has claimed.</p>
